# Lords of War: A Global Arms Trade Analysis

# Introduction & Goals

- This project uses data from [SIPRI's Arms Trade Database](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers) and is a work in progress currently focusing on network analysis using Neo4j and Python of the interconnected relationships between actors in the arms trade.
  - Utilizing data broken down by Supplier and Recipient that I have cleaned extensively for examination and visualization.
  - Used Python's pandas library for large amounts of data cleaning, seaborn library for data visualization during analysis, and Neo4j for graph database storage of highly interrelated trade data.

# The Data Set

- The dataset contains over 25k transactions between over 250 actors(_nation state and non both_) from 1940 to 2019 in the global arms trade.
- I chose this dataset after working on regime change data previously and world unrest, seeing the arms trade as a natural evolution of what to study. I hope to incorporate these projects together(the other mentioned being a stock analysis of defense stock compared to world unrest towards authoriatarianism and the fragility of states undergoing it.)
- The data is wonderfully dense and I am still exploring it and finding new things to study.
- Issues include the rich text format that the data originally was in making it difficult to import and requiring extensive data wrangling, as well as a format not suited for traditional analysis in Python's data science ecosystem.
- What do you want to do with it?

# Conclusion

This project is still in process, keep tuned for more! So far I have gained a greater appreciation for my data cleaning skills, a willingness to tackle the most arcane of datasets, and a deep interest rekindled in this sort of socio-political data.
